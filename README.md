## Overview

This tool helps users track their financial health by visualizing the differenceâ€”or "variance"â€”between their budget and their actual transactions. It's a practical financial analysis application, not a predictive model.

**Key Features:**
-   **CSV Upload:** Allows users to upload their own budget and transaction files.
-   **Automated Analysis:** Automatically aggregates transactions by category and calculates the variance against the budget.
-   **Clear Visualization:** Generates a color-coded bar chart where green bars indicate being under budget (favorable) and red bars indicate overspending (unfavorable).
-   **User-Friendly:** Includes a progress bar to provide feedback when processing large transaction files.

## How to Use

The application requires two CSV files with specific columns:

1.  **Budget File:** A CSV containing at least two columns: `Category` and `Budget`.
2.  **Actuals File:** A CSV of transactions containing at least two columns: `Category` and `Amount`.

Simply upload both files using the interface and click the "Analyze" button to see the results.
